This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to the implicit type coercion within foreach loops. The `bug.php` file contains code that illustrates the problem: a foreach loop prematurely exits when encountering a null value.  The solution, `bugSolution.php`, provides a corrected version which handles null values appropriately.  The issue stems from PHP's loose typing; if a function expects a specific type of data (like an integer) within the array and it receives `null`, instead of triggering a type error, it can lead to unexpected control flow. This is particularly relevant to beginners or those migrating from strongly-typed languages.
